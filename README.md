# Weather-App-Extension
This is a simple weather app made as a Chrome Extension. The app uses the OpenWeatherApp and Google's Reverse Geocoding APIs to retrieve the user's current location, and display
the weather at their location. The app only requires the API keys for each request, and must be allowed access when prompted by the browser. The app is run when the icon is clicked in the Chrome toolbar.
